# 🦾 AMR Enclosure CAD Designs

This repository contains the mechanical design files and hand sketches for the Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) developed as part of our robotics project. All designs were created using SolidWorks, and include both digital CAD models and early-stage hand-drawn concepts.


### 📂 `AMR CAD Design/`
This folder contains:
- 3D design of the complete AMR body and structure
- Chassis components
- Outer covering plates
- Fully assembled SolidWorks model showing the physical structure of the AMR

### 📂 `MCU Enclosure Design/`
This folder includes:
- SolidWorks design files for the microcontroller unit enclosure
- Designs optimized for compactness, ventilation, and secure mounting

### 📂 `hand sketches/`
This folder includes:
- Scanned hand-drawn concept sketches
- Initial design thinking for the AMR body and enclosure layout
- Side and top view diagrams
